    <p>Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa beans that can be a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring in other foods.
        The cacao tree has been used as a source of food for at least 5,300 years, starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador.
        Later, Mesoamerican civilizations consumed cacao beverages, chocolate, was introduced to Europe in the 16th century.</p>
    <p>
        The seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. 
        After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form.
        Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.
        Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa.
        Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and added vegetable oils and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder.
        White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.

         <h2>Etymology</h2>
         <br>
         <center>
         <p> 
            Cocoa is a variant of cacao, likely arising from a confusion with the word coco.Through cacao, it is ultimately derived from kakaw, but whether that word originates in Nahuatl or a Mixe-Zoquean language is the subject of substantial linguistic debate.Chocolate is a Spanish loanword, first recorded in English in 1604,and first recorded in Spanish in 1579.The word for chocolate drink in early Nahuatl texts is cacahuatl meaning "cacao water", which chocolate does not immediately derive from.

         <h2>HISTRORY</h2>
         <br>
         <P>             Evidence for the domestication of the cacao tree exists as early as 5300 BP in South America, in present-day southeast Ecuador by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture, before it was introduced to Mesoamerica.[12] It is unknown when chocolate was first consumed as opposed to other cacao-based drinks, and there is evidence the Olmecs, the earliest known major Mesoamerican civilization, fermented the sweet pulp surrounding the cacao beans into an alcoholic beverage.[13][14] Chocolate was extremely important to several Mesoamerican societies,[15] and cacao was considered a gift from the gods by the Mayans and the Aztecs.[16][17] The cocoa bean was used as a currency across civilizations and was used in ceremonies, as a tribute to leaders and gods and as a medicine.[18][19][20][21][22][23] Chocolate in Mesoamerica was a bitter drink, flavored with additives such as vanilla, earflower and chili, and was capped with a dark brown foam created by pouring the liquid from a height between container</P>
