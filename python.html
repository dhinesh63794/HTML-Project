    <hr>
    <p>Python is an advanced, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. 
     It supports various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional. 
     Python's wide range of applications, from web development and app creation to data analytics and 
     artificial intelligence, underscore its usefulness. Its robust assortment of libraries and 
     frameworks contributes to its popularity among novices and professionals.</p>

    <em>the programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was 
          started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC
          capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
          Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the
          direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, 
          Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).However, Van Rossum stepped down as leader on 
          July 12, 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[7]</em>

          <p>Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
             It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed 
             on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, 
             Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these 
             classes. The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:</p>
